# Minecraft-Xbox-360-Decompilation


## What Is This Project?
This is a **Rewrite** (or Decompilation) of Minecraft for legacy consoles, also known as **Legacy Console Edition (LCE) or just Legacy.**

My initial goal is to rewrite the base game of the xbox 360



This rewrite of the game will be in **C++** using **DirectX and the 360 Xdx**. It will aim to be as close to the original source code and game behaviors **as possible.**

_But in reality, I probably don't even know what I'm doing lolðŸ¦†_

## What Is Minecraft Legacy Console Edition?
Minecraft for legacy consoles was a version of Minecraft ported to consoles by [4J Studios][4j].

This version of the game was discontinued around 2019 and was replaced by the **Bedrock Edition.**

## Progress

(placeholder it's incorrect for now, it will be fixes)
This is the progress of the **current Goal**.

## Tools I Used
To view Minecraft's Java beta 1.6.6 code, I used:
* [RetroMCP][rmcp]: RetroMCP is a modification of the Minecraft Coder Pack.

---

For reverse engineering parts of the game in the binaries of the console's executable, I used: 
* [Ghidra][ghi]: Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework created by the National Security Agency.

---

For loading the .xex along with Ghidra, I used: 
* [XEXLoaderWV][xel]: XEXLoaderWV is a .xex file loader for Ghidra.
