## What Is This Project?

Formally referred to as **LCE Rewritten or simply Rewritten**

This is a **Rewrite** (or Decompilation) of the Minecraft Console Editions, also known as **Legacy Console Edition (LCE) or just Legacy.**

My initial goal is to rewrite base Xbox 360 Edition in **C++** using **DirectX and Xbox 360 xdx**. It will aim to be as close to the original source code and game behaviors **as possible.**

### What Is Minecraft: Legacy Console Edition?
Minecraft: Legacy Console Edition was a suite of Minecraft versions ported to consoles by [4J Studios][4j]. This version of the game was discontinued around 2019 and was replaced by the **Bedrock Edition.** LCE is commonly refered to by millions of people as the **best version of Minecraft**.

### To-Do List
- [ ] Continue to remake class files
- [ ] Continue to rewrite the game
- [ ] Continue to add things to this To-Do List :}

## Useful Things to Know :)
- Base Xbox 360 Edition is basically just Java Edition's Beta 1.6.6, but with features designed for the Xbox 360.
- This rewrite will take a very long time lol.

## Tools I Used
To view Minecraft's Java beta 1.6.6 code, I used:
* [RetroMCP][rmcp]: RetroMCP is a modification of the Minecraft Coder Pack.

For reverse engineering parts of the game in the binaries of the console's executable, I used: 
* [Ghidra][ghi]: Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework created by the National Security Agency.

For loading the .xex along with Ghidra, I used: 
* [XEXLoaderWV][xel]: XEXLoaderWV is a .xex file loader for Ghidra.
